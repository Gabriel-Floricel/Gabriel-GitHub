# Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

#### What you will see here?

- my 6-month journey of learning programming, starting from zero, to where I am now.
- below you will find a handful of projects that I`ve worked on, starting from simple HTML + CSS, to using complex frameworks like React and Redux library.

### My current learning curve

- Here I`ve included some screenshots of some of my main programming skills, as tested with Pluralsight

#### Final notes:

This portfolio will continously update itself over time as I create new projects, using new technologies, frameworks, and libraries.

This is the sum of my current 6-month learning curve.
